            <h2>Chapter from the novel 'Mr. Palomar' by Italo Calvino</h2>
            <p>The sea is barely wrinkled, and little waves strike the sandy
                shore. Mr. Palomar is standing on the shore, looking at a wave.
                Not that he is lost in contemplation of the waves. He is not
                lost, because he is quite aware of what he is doing: he wants to
                look at a wave and he is looking at it. He is not contemplating,
                because for contemplation you need the right temperament, the
                right mood, and the right combination of exterior circumstances;
                and though Mr. Palomar has nothing against contemplation in
                principle, none of these three conditions applies to him.
                Finally, it is not "the waves" that he means to look at, but
                just one individual wave: in his desire to avoid vague
                sensations, he establishes for his every action a limited and
                precise object.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="par2">
            <p>Mr. Palomar sees a wave rise in the distance, grow, approach,
                change form and color, fold over itself, break, vanish, and flow
                again. At this point he could convince himself that he has
                concluded the operation he had set out to achieve, and he could
                go away. But isolating one wave is not easy, separating it from
                the wave immediately following, which seems to push it and at
                times overtakes it and sweeps it away; and it is no easier to
                separate that one wave from the preceding wave, which seems to
                drag it toward the shore, unless it turns against the following
                wave, as if to arrest it, Then, if you consider the breadth of
                the wave, parallel to the shore, it is hard to decide where the
                advancing front extends regularly and where it is separated and
                segmented into independent waves, distinguished by their speed,
                shape, force, direction.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, you cannot observe a wave without bearing in
                mind the complex features that concur in shaping it and the
                other, equally complex ones that the wave itself originates.
                These aspects vary constantly, so each wave is different from
                another wave, even if not immediately adjacent or successive; in
                other words, there are some forms and sequences that are
                repeated, though irregularly distributed in space and time.
                Since what Mr. Palomar means to do at this moment is simply see
                a wave--that is, to perceive all its simultaneous components
                without overlooking any of them--his gaze will dwell on the
                movement of the wave that strikes the shore until it can record
                aspects not previously perceived; as soon as he notices that the
                images are being repeated, he will know he has seen everything
                he wanted to see and he will be able to stop.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="par3">
            <p>A nervous man who lives in a frenzied and congested world, Mr.
                Palomar tends to reduce his relations with the outside world;
                and, to defend himself against the general neurasthenia, he
                tries to keep his sensations under control insofar as possible.
                The hump of the advancing wave rises more at one point than at
                any other, and it is here that it becomes hemmed in white. If
                this occurs at some distance from the shore, there is time for
                the foam to fold over upon itself and vanish again, as if
                swallowed, and at the same moment invade the whole, but this
                time emerging again from below, like a white carpet rising from
                the bank to welcome the wave that is arriving. But just when you
                expect that wave to roll over the carpet, you realize it is no 
                longer wave but only carpet, and this also rapidly disappears,
                to become a flinting of wet sand that quickly disappears, to
                become a glinting of wet sand that quickly withdraws, as if
                driven back by the expansion of the dry, opaque sand that moves
                its jagged edge forward.
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, the indentations in the brow of the wave must
                be considered, where it splits into two wings, one stretching
                toward the shore from right to left and the other from left to
                right, and the departure point of the destination of their
                divergence or convergence is this negative tip, which follows
                the advance of the wings but is always held back, subject to
                their alternate overlapping until another wave, a stronger wave,
                overtakes it, with the same problem of divergence-convergence,
                and then a wave stronger still, which resolves the knot by
                shattering it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="par4">
            <p>Taking the pattern of the waves as model, the beach thrusts into
                the water some faintly hinted points, prolonged in submerged
                sandy shoals, shaped and destroyed by the currents at every
                tide. Mr. Palomar has chosen one of these low tongues of sand as
                his observation point, because the waves strike it on either
                side, obliquely, and, overrunning the half-submerged surface,
                they meet their opposites. So, to understand the composition of
                a wave, you have to consider these opposing thrusts, which are
                to some extend counterbalanced and to some extent added
                together, to produce a general shattering of thrusts and
                counterthrusts in the usual spreading of foam.
                </p>
            <p>Mr. Palomar now tries to limit his field of observation; if he
                bears in mind a square zone of, say, ten meters of shore by ten
                meters of sea, he can carry out an inventory of all the wave
                movements that are repeated with varying frequency within a
                given time interval. The hard thing is to fix the boundaries of
                this zone, because if, for example, he considers as the side
                farthest from him the outstanding line of an advancing wave, as
                this line approaches him and rises it hides from his eyes
                everything behind it, and thus the space under examination is
                overturned and at the same time crushed.
                </p>
            <p>In any case, Mr. Palomar does not lose heart and at each moment
                he thinks he has managed to see everything to be seen from his
                observation point, but then something always crops up that he
                had not borne in mind. If it were not for his impatience to
                reach a complete, definitive conclusion of his visual operation,
                looking at waves would be a very restful exercise for him and
                could save him from neurasthenia, heart attack, and gastric
                ulcer. And it could perhaps be the key to mastering the world's
                complexity by reducing it to its simplest mechanism.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="par5">
            <p>But every attempt to define this model must take into account a
                long wave that is arriving in a direction perpendicular to the
                breakers and parallel to the shore, creating the flow of a
                constant, barely surfacing crest. The shifts of the waves that
                ruffle toward the shore do not disturb the steady impulse of
                this compact crest that slices them at a right angle, and there
                is no knowing where it comes from or where it then goes. Perhaps
                it is a breath of east wind that stirs the sea's surface against
                the deep drive that comes from the mass of water far out to sea, 
                but this wave born of air, in passing, receives also the oblique
                thrusts from the water's depth and redirects them, straightening
                them in its own direction and bearing them along. And so the
                wave continues to grow and gain strength until the clash with
                contrary waves gradually dulls it and makes it disapopear, or
                else twists it until it is confused in one of the many dynasties
                of oblique waves slammed against the shore.</p>
            <p>Concentrating the attention on one aspect makes it leap into the
                foreground and occupy the square, just as, with certain
                drawings, you have only to close your eyes and when you open
                them the perspective has changed. Now, in the overlapping of
                crests moving in various directions, the general pattern seems
                broken down into sections that rise and vanish. In addition, the
                reflux of every wave also has a power of its own that hinders
                the oncoming waves. And if you concentrate your attention on
                these backward thrusts, it seems that the true movement is the
                one that begins from the shore and goes out to sea.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="par6">
            <p id="paragraph">Is this perhaps the real result that Mr. Palomar is about to
                achieve? To make the waves run in the opposite direction, to
                overturn time, to perceive the true substance of the world
                beyond sensory and mental habits? No, he feels a slight
                dizziness, but it goes no further than that. The stubbornness
                that drives the waves toward the shore wins the match: in fact,
                the waves have swelled considerably. Is the wind about to
                change? It would be disastrous if the image that Mr. Palomar has
                succeeded painstakingly in putting together were to shatter and
                be lost. Only if he manages to bear all the aspects in mind at
                once can he begin the second phase of the operation: extending
                this knowledge to the entire universe.</p>
            <p>It would suffice not to lose patience, as he soon does. Mr.
                Palomar goes off along the beach, tense and nervous as when he
                came, and even more unsure about everything.
